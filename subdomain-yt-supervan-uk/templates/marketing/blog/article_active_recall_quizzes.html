        <h1>Active Recall: Why Quizzes Are Better Than Rewatching Lectures</h1>
        <p class="lead">We've all been there: you watch a tutorial, you nod along, you feel like you understand it. Two
            days later, you try to apply the knowledge, and it's gone. This is the "Illusion of Competence."</p>

        <h3>Passive vs. Active Learning</h3>
        <p>Watching a video is a passive activity. Information flows into your working memory, but without effort, it
            rarely transitions to long-term memory. This is where "Active Recall" comes in. It is the practice of
            stimulating your memory during the learning process. Instead of re-reading or re-watching, you test
            yourself.</p>

        <h3>The Forgetting Curve</h3>
        <p>Hermann Ebbinghaus, a German psychologist, coined the term "Forgetting Curve." He showed that we lose about
            50% of new information within an hour and 70% within 24 hours unless we review it. However, *how* we review
            matters. Simply re-watching the video (passive review) is inefficient.</p>

        <h3>The Testing Effect</h3>
        <p>Research consistently shows that taking a quiz immediately after consuming content produces better long-term
            retention than studying the material multiple times. This is known as the "Testing Effect." When you force
            your brain to retrieve an answer, you strengthen the neural pathways associated with that information. It
            signals to your brain: "This information is important; keep it."</p>

        <h3>Automating Active Recall</h3>
        <p>Traditionally, creating flashcards or quizzes takes time—time you could spend learning. This is why we built
            the Quiz feature into SuperVan. By instantly generating 5 key questions from the video transcript, we
            automate the "Active Recall" phase. You don't perform the admin work of creating the test; you just take it.
            This simple 2-minute activity at the end of a video can double your retention rate.</p>

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>If you are watching educational content on YouTube—coding tutorials, history lectures, or financial
            advice—you are investing your time. Protect that investment by ensuring you actually keep the knowledge.
            Stop re-watching. Start testing.</p>
