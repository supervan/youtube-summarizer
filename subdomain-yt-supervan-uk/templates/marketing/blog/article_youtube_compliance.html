        <h1>Understanding YouTube Data Compliance and Privacy</h1>
        <p class="lead">Building tools on top of the YouTube ecosystem requires strict adherence to their Terms of
            Service (ToS) and Developer Policies. Here is how we ensure compliance and protect creator rights.</p>

        <h3>The API vs. Scraping</h3>
        <p>There are two ways to get data from YouTube: the official Data API v3 and scraping. The API is the official
            front door. It has quotas, limits, and strict rules. Scraping is the "back door." At SuperVan, we primarily
            utilize official caption tracks and legitimate data access methods. We respect the `robots.txt` and the
            platform's integrity.</p>

        <h3>Copyright and Fair Use</h3>
        <p>Analyzing a transcript is generally considered "Fair Use" when it is transformative—creating a summary,
            critique, or educational tool—and does not replace the original market for the work. However, reproducing
            the *entire* transcript verbatim can be a gray area. That is why our tools focus on *summarization* and
            *extraction*. We create new value (summaries, quizzes) rather than just mirroring the creator's content.</p>

        <h3>No Video Storage</h3>
        <p>A cardinal rule of YouTube compliance is that you cannot store independent copies of video streams. This
            protects the creator's view counts and ad revenue. If a platform downloads and re-hosts a video, they are
            stealing views. SuperVan is a "pass-through" analysis tool. We process the metadata and text; we do not
            touch the video binary. All video playback on our result pages is done via the official YouTube IFrame
            Player API, ensuring the creator gets their view and ad impression.</p>

        <h3>User Privacy</h3>
        <p>When you use an analysis tool, you are sharing what you watch. We take this seriously. We treat chat logs and
            summary requests as ephemeral data. We do not sell user watch histories to advertisers. Our business model
            is based on providing a utility, not data brokering.</p>

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>The developer ecosystem around YouTube is vibrant, but it must be respectful. By sticking to the rules—no
            downloading, official players, and transformative data use—we build a sustainable tool that benefits viewers
            without harming creators.</p>
