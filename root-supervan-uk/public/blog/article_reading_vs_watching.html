        <h1>Productivity Hack: Reading vs. Watching for Developers</h1>
        <p class="lead">Ask a Senior Developer how they learn a new framework, and they will likely point to the
            documentation. Ask a Junior Developer, and they might send you a YouTube tutorial. Why the difference?</p>

        <h3>The Bandwidth of Text</h3>
        <p>The average human speaks at about 150 words per minute. The average adult reads at 250 words per minute. A
            skilled skimmer (like most developers scanning for code snippets) can process 500+ words per minute. Video
            is inherently throttled by the speed of speech. Even at 2x speed, video is often slower than reading for
            information retrieval.</p>

        <h3>Random Access Memory (RAM) vs. Serial access</h3>
        <p>Text provides "Random Access." You can look at a page, jump to the bottom, glance at a code block, and read
            the first sentence of a paragraph. You are in control of the flow. Video is "Serial Access." You must
            proceed linearly (mostly) to ensure you don't miss context. Scrubbing a video bar is imprecise compared to
            Ctrl+F on a webpage.</p>

        <h3>The Copy-Paste Friction</h3>
        <p>For developers, the inability to copy code directly from a video frame is a massive friction point. It forces
            context switching—looking at the video, typing, looking back. OCR (Optical Character Recognition) tools
            help, but they are clunky. Text-based tutorials allow for instant transfer of syntax to IDE.</p>

        <h3>Why Video Still Wins (Sometimes)</h3>
        <p>This isn't to say video is useless. Video excels at high-level architectural concepts, visual workflows (like
            configuring AWS consoles), and "soft skills" or reasoning. Establishing the *mental model* is often easier
            when hearing an expert explain their thought process. But for the "how-to," text reigns supreme.</p>

        <h3>The SuperVan Hybrid Model</h3>
        <p>This is why we built the "Steps" generator. We take the "Video" content—where the expert explanation
            lives—and convert it into the "Text" format—where the developer productivity lives. You get the expert's
            voice without the bandwidth throttle. It's the best of both worlds.</p>
