        <h1>TikTok Support Now Live: Engineering the Viral Web</h1>
        <p class="lead">The trifecta is complete! Following YouTube and Vimeo, we have now added full support for
            <strong>TikTok</strong>.</p>

        <p>You can now paste any TikTok URL (e.g., <code>tiktok.com/@user/video/123456...</code>) into the summarizer to
            extract transcripts, generate summaries, and analyze viral content with AI.</p>

        <h3>The Engineering Challenge</h3>
        <p>TikTok presents a unique set of challenges compared to long-form video platforms. Here is how we solved them:
        </p>

        <h4>1. Aggressive Blocking & Smart Routing</h4>
        <p>TikTok is notoriously strict about blocking datacenter IP addresses (like the ones our servers run on). Our
            initial implementation faced immediate "100% timeout" rates.</p>
        <p>We solved this with a <strong>hybrid fetch strategy</strong>. The system first attempts a direct, high-speed
            connection. if that fails (as it often does for viral videos), it seamlessly fails over to our
            <strong>rotating residential proxy network</strong>, retrying until it finds a clean path to the content.
        </p>

        <h4>2. Custom Player Integration</h4>
        <p>While YouTube and Vimeo offer standard <code>iframe</code> embeds, TikTok uses a unique "blockquote" embed
            style that requires injecting a dedicated JavaScript SDK. We had to rewrite our frontend player logic to
            dynamically inject this SDK only when a TikTok video is loaded, keeping the site fast and lightweight.</p>

        <h4>3. Metadata Nuances</h4>
        <p>TikTok video IDs are massive (18+ digits) compared to Vimeo's shorter IDs. We updated our URL parsing engine
            to distinguish between these formats instantly, ensuring the correct platform logic is applied before a
            single network request is made. We also handle the lack of public thumbnails by using a smart fallback
            system until the full metadata is retrieved.</p>

        <p>Go ahead and try it out with your favorite educational (or entertaining) TikTok!</p>
