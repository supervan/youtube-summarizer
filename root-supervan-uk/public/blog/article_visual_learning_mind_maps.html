        <h1>Visual Learning: How Mind Maps Improve Memory Retention</h1>
        <p class="lead">Text is linear. Thoughts are not. When we learn complex subjects, our brains naturally try to
            connect concepts, creating a web of relationships. Mind Maps are the external manifestation of this internal
            process.</p>

        <h3>The Dual Coding Theory</h3>
        <p>Approved in 1971 by Allan Paivio, the Dual Coding Theory suggests that we process visual and verbal
            information in separate channels. When you combine them—reading text while seeing a structural diagram—you
            create two separate memory traces. This redundancy makes recall significantly easier. If one path fails, the
            other can retrieve the information.</p>

        <h3>Structure out of Chaos</h3>
        <p>A 40-minute video transcript is a wall of text. It has no visible hierarchy. A Mind Map imposes structure. It
            forces a decision: What is the central theme? What are the primary branches? What are the supporting
            details? By visualizing a video as a tree or graph, you instantly understand the "shape" of the argument or
            tutorial.</p>

        <h3>Mermaid.js and AI</h3>
        <p>Creating Mind Maps manually is an art form, but it's slow. At SuperVan, we use AI to identify the
            hierarchical structure of a video script and then render it using Mermaid.js, a code-based diagramming tool.
            The LLM parses the transcript, identifies the main entity (Top Node), finds the major sub-topics (Child
            Nodes), and links them logically. This happens in seconds.</p>

        <h3>Navigation vs. Consumption</h3>
        <p>One of the biggest benefits of a Mind Map is non-linear navigation. In a video, you must scrub back and forth
            to find connections. In a Mind Map, the connections are drawn lines. You can see that "Concept A" leads to
            "Concept B" but also influences "Concept D" later in the talk. It provides a macro-view that linear playback
            simply cannot offer.</p>

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>For complex topics, reading a summary isn't enough. You need to see how the pieces fit together. Automated
            Mind Mapping is not just a pretty visual; it's a cognitive scaffold that helps you build a robust mental
            model of the subject matter.</p>
