        <h1>Vimeo Support Now Live: How We Built It</h1>
        <p class="lead">We've expanded beyond YouTube! Learn how we integrated Vimeo support into our summarizer and the
            technical hurdles we overcame.</p>

        <p>We are excited to announce that <strong>Top Level Domain/Watch (TL;DW)</strong> now supports
            <strong>Vimeo</strong> videos! 🎉</p>

        <p>You can now paste any Vimeo URL (e.g., <code>vimeo.com/123456789</code>) into the summarizer, and our AI will
            extract the transcript, generate a summary, and even create a visual infographic just like it does for
            YouTube.</p>

        <h3>The Technical Journey</h3>
        <p>Adding Vimeo support wasn't just a simple configuration change. It involved solving three key engineering
            challenges:</p>

        <h4>1. API vs. Cookies</h4>
        <p>Unlike YouTube, which we access via a mix of API and standard web scraping, Vimeo often requires strict
            authentication for high-quality metadata. We had to implement a secure, environment-based cookie injection
            system (<code>VIMEO_COOKIES</code>) to allow our backend to "view" the videos as an authenticated user,
            ensuring we can fetch accurate transcripts even for age-gated or sensitive content.</p>

        <h4>2. Avoiding Regression</h4>
        <p>Our YouTube fetcher is a complex beast, handling proxy rotation, bot detection (PO Token), and multiple
            fallback methods. To ensure we didn't break our core feature while adding Vimeo, we strictly successfully
            <strong>separated concerns</strong>. We built a dedicated <code>_fetch_vimeo_transcript</code> function that
            operates completely independently from the YouTube logic. The main endpoint now acts as a smart router,
            detecting the video platform and dispatching the request to the correct handler.</p>

        <h4>3. Frontend Logic</h4>
        <p>The frontend was originally hardcoded to reject any URL that didn't look like <code>youtube.com</code>. We
            had to rewrite our validation regex to be platform-agnostic and update the video player logic. Since Vimeo
            doesn't provide a public thumbnail endpoint like YouTube (without an API key), we updated our backend to
            fetch the thumbnail during the scraping process and pass it to the frontend, ensuring a seamless visual
            experience.</p>
